# claude-skills

Personal Claude Code setup for Lorenzo Graizzaro:

- **skills** (this tree, by category) — loaded on demand when a task matches their `description`.
- **[`config/`](./config/)** — `CLAUDE.md`, path-scoped `rules/`, and lifecycle `hooks/`,
  symlinked into `~/.claude/`. See [`config/README.md`](./config/README.md).

`~/.agents/skills` is a clone of this repo; `~/projects/claude-skills` is a second clone (public showcase).

## How skills are discovered

Claude Code only discovers skills at `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` —
**direct children, no category subfolders**. A path like
`~/.claude/skills/development/code-documenter/SKILL.md` is **not** detected.

So the layout is split in two:

| Layer | Path | Structure |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Source of truth** (this repo, cloned to `~/.agents/skills`) | `~/.agents/skills/<category>/<skill>/SKILL.md` | organised by category |
| **What Claude Code reads** | `~/.claude/skills/<skill>` → symlink into the tree | **flat** |

`~/.agents/skills` is never read by Claude Code directly, only the flat symlink
mirror in `~/.claude/skills`. Directory symlinks are officially supported and a
skill reachable from more than one path is loaded once.

Run [`./sync.sh`](./sync.sh) after adding, moving, or removing a skill to
regenerate the flat symlinks in `~/.claude/skills`.

## Skills linked from other repos

These are **not** stored here. They live in their own repos and are symlinked
into `~/.agents/skills` (and mirrored flat into `~/.claude/skills`).

| Skill | Source repo | Conceptual category |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| `sam-deploy`, `lambda-patterns`, `cost-optimizer`, `serverless-scanner` | [`LorenGrz/aws-skills`](https://github.com/LorenGrz/aws-skills) | devops |
| `iam-least-privilege` | [`LorenGrz/aws-skills`](https://github.com/LorenGrz/aws-skills) | security |
| `apexlang` (Oracle APEX app generation) | [`oracle/skills`](https://github.com/oracle/skills) — `apex/apexlang`, UPL-1.0 | development |
| `omarchy`, `diagnose-crash` | `/usr/share/omarchy/default/agents/skills/` (ships with Omarchy) | system |

`omarchy` and `diagnose-crash` are not vendored here — they update with the OS.
On a machine without Omarchy, install it (or skip those two skills).

## Clones

- `~/.agents/skills` — the working hub. Git clone of this repo; the flat mirror
  in `~/.claude/skills` symlinks into it. Edit here.
- `~/projects/claude-skills` — a second clone, the public showcase. Keep it
  current with `git -C ~/projects/claude-skills pull` after pushing.

## Setup on a new machine

```bash
# 1. Clone the hub
git clone https://github.com/LorenGrz/claude-skills ~/.agents/skills

# 2. Link the external skill repos (see table above), e.g.
git clone https://github.com/LorenGrz/aws-skills ~/projects/aws-skills
git clone https://github.com/oracle/skills ~/projects/oracle-skills
ln -sfn ~/projects/oracle-skills/apex/apexlang ~/.agents/skills/apexlang

# 3. Generate the flat symlink mirror Claude Code reads
cd ~/.agents/skills && ./sync.sh
```

## Adding or changing a skill

1. Create/edit `~/.agents/skills/<category>/<skill>/SKILL.md`.
2. Frontmatter: `name`, a specific `description` starting with "Use this skill
   when…", optional `metadata`, optional `paths:` to auto-activate for matching
   files.
3. Run `./sync.sh` to refresh `~/.claude/skills`.
4. `git commit` and `git push`, then pull in the showcase clone.
