# React Component Validator

## Objective

Keep React components predictable, readable, and lifecycle-safe by avoiding unnecessary effects and extracting reusable behavior into clean hooks.

## Validation Checklist

Before adding or changing `useEffect`, ask whether the logic can be expressed through:

- Render-time derived values.
- Event handlers.
- Reducer state transitions.
- Server state or query library APIs.
- A custom hook with explicit inputs and outputs.
- A project-standard lifecycle helper such as `useOnInit`.

## Effect Rules

- Do not use `useEffect` to derive state that can be computed during render.
- Do not use `useEffect` to mirror props into local state unless there is a clear reset or synchronization requirement.
- Do not omit dependencies to force one-time execution.
- Do not hide dependency issues with broad eslint disables.
- Do not mix unrelated responsibilities in a single effect.
- Always return cleanup functions for subscriptions, timers, observers, sockets, and external listeners.

## `useOnInit` Standard

Use `useOnInit` or the repository's equivalent lifecycle hook for intentional mount-only initialization when the codebase already provides that standard.

Expected usage pattern:

```tsx
useOnInit(() => {
  loadInitialData();
});
```

If the project does not provide `useOnInit`, prefer an explicit custom hook for the behavior rather than adding ad hoc lifecycle effects throughout components.

## Custom Hook Guidance

Extract a hook when lifecycle logic:

- Is reused by multiple components.
- Coordinates async loading, subscriptions, timers, or browser APIs.
- Makes the component difficult to scan.
- Requires cleanup or cancellation.

Custom hooks should expose a small API:

```tsx
const { data, status, retry } = useFeatureData(featureId);
```

## Component Rules

- Keep components focused on rendering and user interaction.
- Keep async orchestration, subscriptions, and integration logic outside presentational components.
- Prefer controlled data flow over local synchronization effects.
- Prefer explicit status states over boolean combinations that become ambiguous.
- Preserve existing project conventions for state libraries, query clients, forms, and routing.
- In Next.js, keep components as server components unless interactivity, browser APIs, or client-side hooks require `"use client"`.
- In React Native, account for app lifecycle, platform-specific APIs, and native subscriptions when validating effects.

## Review Output

When acting as a validator, report issues in this order:

1. Broken lifecycle behavior or stale closure risk.
2. Unnecessary effects that should be render-time derivations.
3. Missing cleanup or cancellation.
4. Hook extraction opportunities.
5. Naming or organization improvements.

## Compatibility Notes

- Pair this skill with `react-scalable-frontend` for broad frontend architecture decisions.
- Pair this skill with `nextjs-ssr-frontend` when reviewing server/client boundaries.
- Pair this skill with `react-native-mobile` when lifecycle behavior depends on mobile APIs.
